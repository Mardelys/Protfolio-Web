               <p>Hello, my name is Mardelys Torres, I enjoy creating and developing websites, I like interface design and putting it into practice every time I develop a project fills me with joy and satisfaction by appreciating how much progress I have made with time and practice. I started learning as a self-taught person in 2021 and managed to learn HTML and css, however, I learned a lot by taking the Educam√°s programming bootcamp "Programate Academy".</p>
               <p>My main focus is to create applications that are useful and pleasant to the user, develop complete projects and that satisfy the needs of the client.</p>
